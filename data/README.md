# Get the raw data and cleaned data

To get the data run **in the cluster**:
```shell
$ bash get_data.sh your_cluster_username
```

The output files are:

 - `all_IMPACT_mutations_180508.txt`: raw dataset (IMPACT mutations data shared by Ahmet on the 180508).

 - `cleaned_IMPACT_mutations_180508.txt`: cleaned dataset (dataset obtained at the end of `first_analysis.ipynb`).
