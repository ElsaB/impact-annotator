# Synonymous study [Pierre] 

### List of all the notebooks

* **[`synonymous_mutations_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/synonymous_study/synonymous_mutations_analysis.ipynb)**  
This study will focus only on the `synonymous_SNV` mutations, trying first to filter the non-somatic synonymous mutations and then to study the reccurent synonymous mutations. This notebook follows the methodology of the [`coding_mutations_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/first_study/coding_mutations_analysis.ipynb) notebook. The [`/synonymous_mutations_analysis_extra`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/synonymous_study/synonymous_mutations_analysis_extra) folder contains extra material detailed in the notebook for the study of the `synonymous_SNV` mutations.
