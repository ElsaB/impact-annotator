**Article:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763410/, published in Cancer Res. in Auguts 2009 [Cancer-specific High-throughput Annotation of Somatic Mutations: computational prediction of driver missense mutations]  
**Author:** Karchin Lab (Johns Hopkins University)   

From the article:

* Somatic and missense mutations only
* Discriminate between known driver missense mutations and randomly generated missense mutations
* Area under ROC curve > 0.91, area under precision-recall curve > 0.79
* Supervised machine learning:
	* Random Forest trained on 49 predictive features (cf. supplementary material)
	* 500 trees and default parameters (mtry = 7)
	* Feature selection done with a protocol based on mutual information (generalized version of correlation)
	* Features with missing values estimated with k-nearest neighbors algorithm
	* Prior to training all features standardized with the Z-score method
	* Compared with SVM
* Database:
	* 2488 missense driver mutations from COSMIC database and recent research (1244 for feature selection and 1244 for classifier training)
	* Synthetic passenger generated by sampling from eight multinomial distributions that depend on di-nucleotide context and tumor type (4500 for feature selection and 4500 for classifier training)
* Comparison with PolyPhen, SIFT, CanPredict and KinaseSVM
