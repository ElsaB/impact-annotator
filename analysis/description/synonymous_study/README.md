# Synonymous study [Pierre] 

### List of all the notebooks

* **[`synonymous_mutations_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/180731_pierre/synonymous_mutations_analysis.ipynb)** :construction: *work in progress* :construction:   
This study will focus only on the `synonymous_SNV` mutations, trying first to filter the non-somatic synonymous mutations and then to study the reccurent synonymous mutations. This notebook follows the methodology of the [`coding_mutations_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/180731_pierre/coding_mutations_analysis.ipynb) notebook. The [`/synonymous_mutations_analysis_extra`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/180731_pierre/synonymous_mutations_analysis_extra) folder contains extra material detailed in the notebook for the study of the `synonymous_SNV` mutations.


### Details on the notebooks
All notebooks will begin with the following lines, which load a set of custom function designed by us, and setup the R environment by loading the appropriate libraries:
```R
source("../../../src/utils/custom_tools.R")
setup_environment("../../../src/utils")
```
