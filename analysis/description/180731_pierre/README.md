List of the notebooks (and the order to read them):

* **[`first_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/180731_pierre/first_analysis.ipynb)**   
First look at the awa data `all_IMPACT_mutations_180508.txt`. This notebook is centered on the analysis of the data feature per
feature, and on the different filters applied on the dataset to clean it. The fifth part only will mix different features to
study the relation between them.

* **[`unsolved_questions.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/180731_pierre/unsolved_questions.ipynb)**  
List of all the unsolved questions/issues found in the raw data `all_IMPACT_mutations_180508.txt`, this notebook should be read
in the context of `first_analysis.ipynb` which periodically refers to it.  

* **[`coding_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/180731_pierre/coding_analysis.ipynb)**  
Further analysis on the raw data `all_IMPACT_mutations_180508.txt` using the filtered dataset obtained at the end of
`first_analysis.ipynb`, enriched with the annotations from the `add_features()` function obtained at the end of 
`annotating.ipynb`.

* **[`synonymous_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/180731_pierre/synonymous_analysis.ipynb)**  
*Work in progress...*

*Work in progress...*

* **[`comparison_between_variant_annotation_databases.ipynb`](https://github.com/ElsaB/impact-annotator/blob/master/analysis/description/180731_pierre/comparison_between_variant_annotation_databases.ipynb)**
